* longest consecutive sequence

https://neetcode.io/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence

Given an array of integers nums, return the length of the longest
consecutive sequence of elements that can be formed.

A consecutive sequence is a sequence of elements in which each element
is exactly 1 greater than the previous element. The elements do not
have to be consecutive in the original array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.
